    <title>Sato Wakajima Death - The Truth</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        I actually saw Jima hiding behind the bathroom door with a knife in his hand. <br>
        I have been using the company's money to go on lavish vacation with my boyfriend. <br>
        I do not want police to be invovled in this. I do not want my boyfriend to be in trouble. <br>
        I told Jima to hide until ambulance arrived and pretended to be surprised and joined the ambulance to the
        hospital. <br>
        I buried the knife before the police arrived. <br>
        I was the one that wiped the letter on the bathroom tile next to his hand. <br>
        Now I am afraid that Jima might kill me because I am the only one who knows about this. <br>
        Therefore, I would like the police to know that Jima has the potential to kill me.<br>
